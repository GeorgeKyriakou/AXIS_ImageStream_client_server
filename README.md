This project was part of an assignment for the Computer Science masters program at Malmö Högskola, Sweden. 
It consists of a client side written in Java which runs on our machine, and a server written in C which is uploaded and run on an AXIS Communications™ camera.
The server uses utilities provided by AXIS (ACAP), and it can handle multiple clients at the same time with different resolutions and frame rates for each one.
